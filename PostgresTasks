||G1||Dead Query Script||Write a script to: find queries defined but not referenced in perl code; find queries defined but not referenced in java code; find queries defined in both (perl migrated to java).|| done ||dgoodwin|| determined that the number of queries involved did not warrant the risk ||
||G2||Query Script||Enhance script to list files containing SQL; provides file and query counts|| done || zeus || [attachment:file_query_count script]||

||G5||Postgres Schema||Create test version of Postgres schema, for testing of queries|| done || jortel || Used ora2pg 4.11 generated [[attachment:ddl.sql.gz?format=raw ddl]] '''DDL only'''.  See G10. ||
||G6||Database Versions||What is the minimum supported version of  Postgres?|| jortel || done || ![1] This will depend on targeted versions of RHEL.  '''Decided''': RHEL5+ which means '''8.1+'''||
||G7||Custom Data Type||Add EVR_T data type with aggregate|| ||  || Only (1) table with this column type: RHNPACKAGEEVR. ||
||G8||Prepare git branch||Either clean up the existing postgres branch, or create a new branch and ''cherry pick'' Devin's changes|| done ||dgoodwin|| Would be good to have this by COB 12/19 ||
||G9||Postgres Dev Packages||Create a devel yum repo containing custom packages required for satellite to use __both__ oracle and postgres|| || dgoogwin|| ||
||G10||Postgres DDL|| Publish an initial postgres schema generated by ora2pg  || done || jortel,bmomjian || Files added to git and are to be cleaned up by bmomjian ||
||G11||Sample Dataset||Create a sample database dataset that can be loaded in both oracle and postgres to be used by developers|| || jortel||||
||G12||Monitoring||Are we converting the monitoring module?|| done || tsanders || Yes ||
||G13||Remove dead java queries|| Remove the dead java data source queries from git || done || dgoodwin ||  ||
||G14||Orafce|| Orafce requires Postgres 8.2; port Orafce to Postgres 8.1; packaging issues? || || bmomjian || Orafce 3.0 back-ported to 8.1 in orafce CVS||
||G15|| Setup schema review meeting || Have developers review schema beforehand, meet to discuss core tables and answer questions with as many developers as possible. || done || jortel || ||
||G16|| db-control || what about the RHN db-control stuff.  It's probably oracle based || || || ||
||G17|| Prioritized Modules || Provide a prioritized list of modules (feature sets).  || 25% done || jortel || Iteration 1 scoped but need to do 3+. ||

=== Table (DDL) Migration ===

Here is the assignment table for migrating the table DDL.  Please put you name in the ''Assigned'' column __before__ you begin working on a table.  Start by copying
oracle .sql file located in $GIT/spacewalk/schema/spacewalk/rhnsat/tables to $GIT/spacewalk/schema/spacewalk/postgresql/tables.  Then proceed with the migration.
Also, please note any items of interest in the ''notes'' column and be sure to follow the [wiki:PostgresPortingGuidelines porting guidelines].

=== Stored Procedure Migration ===

Here is the assignment table for migrating the stored procedures __not__ associated with a package.  Please put you name in the ''Assigned'' column __before__ you begin 
working on a procedure.  Start by copying oracle .sql file located in $GIT/spacewalk/schema/spacewalk/rhnsat/procs to $GIT/spacewalk/schema/spacewalk/postgresql/procedures.
Then proceed with the migration.  Also, please note any items of interest in the ''notes'' column and sure to follow the [wiki:PostgresPortingGuidelines porting guidelines].
