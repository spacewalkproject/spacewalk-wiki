Hola Spacewalkers,

The Spacewalk team is happy to announce another release of Spacewalk. In a few hours, Spacewalk 0.5 will be available for install. As with previous releases, 0.3 will no longer be available.

NOTE: upgrades are not yet available for 0.5. We hope to have these instructions ready later this week.

Also note, that the URL for the repo has changed. The OLD url was:

{{{
   http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.4/rhel/5Server/<arch>
   http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.4/fedora/9/<arch>
}}}

The NEW url is:

{{{
   http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.5/RHEL/5/<arch>/os/
   http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.5/Fedora/10/<arch>/os/
}}}
