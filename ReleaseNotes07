Heya Spacewalkers,

Spacewalk 0.7 is finally here!

{{{
   http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.7/RHEL/5/<arch>/
   http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.7/Fedora/11/<arch>/
   http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.7/Fedora/12/<arch>/
}}}

For the first time we split server and client part. Client repo is:

{{{
   http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.7-client/RHEL/5/<arch>/
   http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.7-client/Fedora/11/<arch>/
   http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.7-client/Fedora/12/<arch>/
}}}

   https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/Features/WebuiErrataAndCvesEnhancements

* Spacewalk can be installed on Fedora 12

* Top level package spacewalk do not exists any more. It has been split into spacewalk-oracle and spacewalk-postgresql, which depends on oracle or postgresql library.
    Note: postgresql version is highly experimental.

* Spacewalk now tracks date and time of package installation

* Config channels now can handle symlinks.

* Support for WebUI based KVM guest management & provisioning.

* New script "monitoring-data-cleanup" allows you to delete old monitoring data.

* Base client packages are now in Fedora. That means you are now able to register Fedora machine to Spacewalk, without setting up additional repository.

* Spacewalk repositories have been split to server and client parts.

* Client tools now can report diff in selinux context.

* Satellite-sync improvements.

* API call system.listPackages now return additional field "installtime".

...and of course many bugfixes

== Known issues ==

* Documentation search does not work, other search are unaffected.
