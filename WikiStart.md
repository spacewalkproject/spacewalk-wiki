## __Introduction__

[Spacewalk](http://spacewalk.redhat.com/) is an open source Linux systems management solution.  It allows you to:

 * Inventory your systems (hardware and software information)
 * Install and update software on your systems
 * Collect and distribute your custom software packages into manageable groups
 * Provision (Kickstart) your systems
 * Manage and deploy configuration files to your systems
 * Provision virtual guests
 * Start/stop/configure virtual guests

Spacewalk is the upstream project for the source of [Red Hat Satellite](http://www.redhat.com/red_hat_network/). Spacewalk works with RHEL, Fedora, and other RHEL derivative distributions like CentOS, Scientific Linux, etc. Limited support for managing [Debian](RegisteringClients) machines is also available. We are working on getting Spacewalk packages included in Fedora.

This wiki is primarily focused on the usage and development of Spacewalk. For a higher-level overview of Spacewalk, what it does, and for a full gallery of screenshots, please visit the [Spacewalk website at redhat.com](http://spacewalk.redhat.com/).
