= XML-RPC Handlers =
Spacewalk exports a significant chunk of operations through its XML-RPC API. This page is intended to get you up and running with sample client scripts, and implement a sample XML-RPC call in one of the handlers. To find the list of supported API calls goto ApiDocs.

== Using the API ==

Suppose one wants to obtain a list of users in his/her organization, the org admin would typically generate a client script like this in python.
{{{
#!python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import xmlrpclib

SATELLITE_HOST = "<your satellite address>"
SATELLITE_URL = "http://%s/rpc/api" % SATELLITE_HOST
login = "admin"
password = "password"

#connect to the server
client = xmlrpclib.Server(SATELLITE_URL, verbose=0)
# get the session key
key = client.auth.login(login, password)
# get the list of users
print client.user.list_users(key)
}}}

== Parts of the server side making up the call ==

Lets trace through the example call {{{client.user.list_users(key)}}}. There are two parts to this call,
{{{.user}}} is the XML-RPC name space used to group logical methods together. The other part is {{{list_users(key)}}} which is the method called in the name space.
Alternatively, methods can be specified in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase camelCase] such as {{{listUsers(key)}}}. The frontend API knows how to parse both types of calls.

 NOTE: we need to expand the section below

In the case of a bug in this call you would, 

 * look at /eng/java/code/src/com/redhat/rhn/frontend/xmlrpc/handler-manifest.xml to figure out the class handling the "user" name space {{{<template name="user" classname="com.redhat.rhn.frontend.xmlrpc.user.UserHandler" />}}}
 * look {{{listUsers(String sessionKey)}}} method in /eng/java/code/src/com/redhat/rhn/frontend/xmlrpc/user/UserHandler.java and trace the bug from there
