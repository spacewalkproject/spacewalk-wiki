= Orafce Testing =

== Overview ==

The Motive of the testing is to make sure that Orafce "Oracle Function " features is compatible with Postgres and also used by spacewalk.

The minimum supported version of Postgres is PG 8.1+.

Targeted version of Orafce is 3.0.0.

=== Oracle Compatible Function's of Orafce being used in Spacewalk ===


||'''Function Name'''||'''Remarks'''||
||DBMS_OUTPUT|| To see the data we must have to enable the serveroutput on also we need to Use select statement before DBMS_OUTPUT,we can also use in RETURN statement of Plpgsql fuctions ||
||NVL|| It is almost Compatible with oracle but  it give  Error due to its PG limitation for ex:-{{{select nvl('a','b') from dual;ERROR:  could not determine anyarray/anyelement type because input has type "unknown"}}}.Comments which i have got from Itagaki: "Yeah, PostgreSQL 8.2 has a limitation in treating anyelement.Please use 8.3 or add explicit type casts".so this is applicable for 8.1 too ||
||NVL2|| same commets which has given for NVL ||
||ROUND|| spacewalk is using this function like RETURN and IF statement ||
||TRUNC|| spacwalk is using this function for passing to variable i.e target_date := trunc(add_months(sysdate,-months_ago)-(7*weeks_ago))||
||SUBSTR|| It is better to use oracle.substr instead of substr in PG because by default it will search in pg_catalog.substr which is not oracle compatible ||
||INSTR|| It is using in IF,inside Substr function ||
||DECODE|| Same comments which has given for NVL2 ||
||LENGTH|| it is commanly using in DBMS_OUTPUT,SUBSTR,IF,FOR Loop||
||LAST_DAY||using this function for passing to variable i.e target_date := last_day(target_date)||
||ADD_MONTHS||one of the sql statment using by spacewalk is add_months(sysdate,-5)-(7*5) , if we changed sysdate to current_timestamp and try to run this query, it will throw an error saying:-ERROR:  function add_months(timestamp with time zone, integer) does not exist,to avoid this error ,either we can use explicit type casting OR instead of using Current_timestamp ,we can use current_date.||
||BITAND|| Being used in the function adler32 ||

=== Oracle Compatible Function's of Orafce '''NOT''' being used in Spacewalk ===

'''About the Bugs and Issue's raised so far ...'''

Reported in January http://lists.pgfoundry.org/pipermail/orafce-general/2009-January/thread.html.

Reported in Feburary http://lists.pgfoundry.org/pipermail/orafce-general/2009-February/thread.html.



=== Test Cases ===

The Test cases file has been uploaded in this link ,the sql file name is "orafce_testcases_version0.1.sql"


=== Limitation ===

1.Oracle grouping function is not supported by Orafce.

{{{
./schema/util/scripts/hwreport.sql:--    DECODE(GROUPING(model), 1, 'All Models', model) "CPU Model",
./schema/util/scripts/hwreport.sql:--    DECODE(GROUPING(rhnCpuSpeedRangeFunc(mhz)), 1, 'All Speeds',
}}}

'''NOTE:'''

{{{ 
It is Commented so we should not worry for this.
}}}

2.In Most of the function ,we have to use  explicit type casting  because PostgreSQL 8.2/8.1 has a limitation in treating anyelement-

{{{  
Example:-select decode(1,1,null::int)
}}} 

 for more detail pls review  test-case file(orafce_testcases_version0.1.sql)

=== Sql File's Location ===

[wiki:"Sql Files Location" Sql File Location for Oracle(Supported by Orafce) Built-in functions using by spacewalk]


=== Conclusion ===

* This is all about Orafce Feature's apart from this, there are other Single-row functions which are Using by spacewalk which has been taken care in other wiki page.

* Grouping is not a part of  Orafce Feature but still mentioning here .

* Orafce 3.0.0 testing done aganist PG8.1 . currently one has to update the orafce 3.0.0 with CVS to run against PG8.1
